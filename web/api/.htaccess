# API Authentication
# This file handles authentication for API requests differently

# No direct PHP execution from outside the API folder
<Files ~ "\.php$">
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
</Files>

# API endpoints have their own authentication logic
# This prevents them from being affected by the main auth_check.php script
