# Security Features

The ECG monitoring system implements several security measures to protect sensitive patient data:

## Data Protection

- **Hashing**: Sensitive data is hashed using SHA-256 with a security key
  - Implementation in [web/config/security.php](mdc:web/config/security.php)
  - The hash key "test2025" is used for all hashing operations

- **Encoding**: Personal information is encoded in base64
  - Functions for encoding/decoding in [web/config/security.php](mdc:web/config/security.php)
  - Applied to patient names, addresses, and identification numbers

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt
  - Password verification implemented in security functions
  - Protects against database breaches

- **CSRF Protection**: Forms are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery
  - Token generation and verification in [web/config/security.php](mdc:web/config/security.php)
  - Applied to all sensitive form submissions

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
  - Special character escaping and input cleaning
  - Parameterized SQL queries via PDO
