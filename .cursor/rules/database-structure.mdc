# Database Structure

The ECG monitoring system uses a MySQL database with the following main tables:

## Tables

1. **Patients**: Stores patient information with security measures (hashing/encoding)
   - Schema found in [database/init.sql](mdc:database/init.sql)
   - Patient data is protected with hashing and base64 encoding

2. **Configurations**: Stores ECG acquisition configuration data
   - Links to patients through foreign key
   - Includes acquisition duration settings

3. **ECG Data**: Stores actual ECG signal values
   - Time-series data linked to configuration sessions
   - Indexed for efficient querying

4. **Diagnostics**: Stores medical analysis and results
   - Contains wave measurements (P, Q, R, S, T)
   - Includes medical reports and findings

5. **Users**: Authentication system with role-based access
   - Supports roles: admin, medecin, patient
   - Passwords securely hashed with bcrypt

## Database Connections

Database interactions use PDO for secure, parameterized queries as implemented in [web/config/database.php](mdc:web/config/database.php)
